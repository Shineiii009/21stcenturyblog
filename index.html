            <h1>A Blog Entry on "Apo on the Wall" by BJ Patino</h1>
            <p> I liked "Apo on the Wall" for its vivid storytelling and the underlying tension it creates. The poem captures the curiosity of a child exploring his father’s office, filled with military symbols and a looming portrait of a figure called "Apo." The father’s stern nature and the child’s innocent perspective provide a contrast that feels personal yet reflects larger historical narratives. The simplicity of the language contrasts
                 with the depth of the emotions and themes hidden within, making the poem accessible but profound.</p><br>
                 
            <p>The poem emphasizes the ever-watchful presence of authority, whether it is a father or a figure like "Apo" (a reference to former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos). It suggests a feeling of constant surveillance, fear, and submission to authority figures. From the child’s point of view, the presence of his father’s boss (Apo) on the wall isn’t just a photo but a symbol of the pervasive control that affects not only his father’s life but also the entire household. 
                The child’s experience highlights the indirect but powerful ways that political regimes
                 infiltrate personal and domestic spaces.</p><br>
            <p>This poem deepened my appreciation of how personal experiences and political history intertwine. Reflecting on the 
                authoritarian period in Philippine history, "Apo on the Wall" reminded me of how past events still influence present-day society. It shows that even at home, symbols of power and control can shape family dynamics and personal perceptions. It made me think about how people today still carry the weight of the past, 
                how authority continues to exert influence, and how historical trauma can permeate even the most personal spaces.</p>
